    <section>
        <h2>Definition of Social Sciences</h2>
        <p>The social sciences study society, human behavior, and the forces shaping social interactions. Key disciplines include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Anthropology</strong> - Examines ancient cultures and human evolution.</li>
            <li><strong>Demography</strong> - Analyzes population size, structure, and trends.</li>
            <li><strong>Economics</strong> - Focuses on resource allocation to meet unlimited human needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Geography</strong> - Studies human-environment interactions and spatial patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>History</strong> - Systematically investigates past events to understand their impact.</li>
            <li><strong>Linguistics</strong> - Explores language structure, acquisition, and cultural significance.</li>

            <li><strong>Natural Sciences</strong> - Examine natural phenomena (e.g., physics, biology).</li>
            <li><strong>Humanities</strong> - Focus on human expression and philosophy (e.g., literature, art).</li>
            <li><strong>Similarity</strong> - All use research methods to explain phenomena, but differ in focus (tangible vs. intangible).</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Historical Context of Key Disciplines</h2>
        <ol>

    <h1>Module 2</h1>
    <h1>Philippine Politics & Governance</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Politics: Arena vs Process</h2>
        <p><strong>Arena Approach</strong> - Focuses on formal political institutions like the state, laws, and policies. It views politics as the "authoritative allocation of values" (Easton, 1957).</p>
        <p><strong>Process Approach</strong> - Extends beyond government to include institutions like unions, corporations, and NGOs that influence societal rules.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Definition of Politics</h2>
        <p>Defined as “the authoritative allocation of values for a society” (1953) and the study of politics as “understanding how authoritative decisions are made and executed for a society.” (1957).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Politics as About Governing</h2>
        <p>Government is the term used to describe formal institutions (groups of people that are ruled or governed). It extends to include the persons and organizations that make, enforce political decisions for society. Also included are non-government organizations (trade unions, corporations, NGOs) that influence rules and member behavior.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Politics as Governance</h2>
        <p>Governance is broader than government, encompassing public and private systems that organize societal, economic, and political life. It involves formal/informal rules, norms, and institutions (from local to global) that govern behavior.</p>
