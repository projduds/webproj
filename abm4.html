Its primary goal is to increase the company's stock value through strategic decisions about investments, financing, and operations. Financial risk management is crucial as unexpected events can lead to financial losses.</p>

  <h2>Corporate Structure & Responsibilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Shareholders:</strong> Owners who elect the Board of Directors (1 share = 1 vote)</li>
    <li><strong>Board of Directors:</strong> Top policy-makers who ensure the company serves shareholders' interests by:
      <ul>
        <li>Setting investment and dividend policies</li>

        <li>Appointing/removing top management</li>
        <li>Determining executive compensation</li>
        <li>Reviewing financial disclosures</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>President/CEO:</strong> Oversees operations and implements board-approved strategies while representing the company publicly.</li>
    <li><strong>Vice Presidents:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Develops sales strategies, analyzes competition, and manages customer relationships</li>
        <li><strong>Production:</strong> Optimizes manufacturing processes, minimizes costs, and manages supply chains</li>

    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Financial Concepts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Principle 1: Time Value of Money</strong> – Money today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its earning potential.</li>
    <li><strong>Principle 2: Risk-Return Tradeoff</strong> – Higher-risk investments require higher returns to attract investors.</li>
    <li><strong>Principle 3: Cash Flows are the Source of Value</strong> – Real cash inflows/outflows reflect a business’s financial health, not accounting profits.</li>
    <li><strong>Principle 4: Market Efficiency</strong> – Developed markets adjust quickly to new information, making it hard to profit from public data.</li>
    <li><strong>Principle 5: Incentives Drive Individuals</strong> – Misaligned incentives between managers and owners can reduce firm value.</li>
